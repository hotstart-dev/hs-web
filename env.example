# API Gateway URL
# -----------------
# ALL backend requests go through the centralized gateway.
# The gateway routes to individual services:
#   /auth/*      → Auth service
#   /blueprint/* → Blueprint service
#   /ui/*        → UI service
#   /billing/*   → Billing service

# For local development (local gateway):
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8787

# For production (ALWAYS use the gateway, never direct worker URLs):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.hotstart.dev

# ⚠️  NEVER use direct worker URLs like:
#     https://hs-auth.*.workers.dev
#     https://hs-blueprint.*.workers.dev
#     All requests MUST go through the gateway!
